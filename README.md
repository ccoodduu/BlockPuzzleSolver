A solver I wrote for the IQ-block puzzle.

It is written using C# and a .NET Console Application, you can run it by opening the solution in Visual Studio 2022.

The reason it is so fast is becuase it uses bitboards and bitwise operations. 

I also made a little browser-application where you can look/search through all the solution: https://ccoodduu.github.io/iq-block-display/
